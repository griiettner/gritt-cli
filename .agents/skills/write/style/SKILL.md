# Style patterns

Read [write](../SKILL.md) first.

### 14. Em dashes (and en dashes): cut them

**Base rule:** The final rewrite contains no em dashes (—) or en dashes (–). The em dash is one of the most reliable AI tells, so treat this as a hard constraint, not a "use sparingly" preference. Replace each one, in rough order of preference: a period (start a new sentence), a comma (a tight aside), a colon (introducing an explanation), parentheses (a true aside), or restructure the sentence. Also catch spaced em dashes (` — `) and double hyphens (` -- `) used the same way.

**Stricter repository rule:** Avoid em dashes entirely. Use periods or commas only (no parentheses, no en dashes, no hyphen-as-dash substitutes). Em dashes are an AI tell, and reaching for parentheses instead just trades one tell for another. If a thought needs separation, end the sentence or use a comma.

**Final constraint:** Follow the stricter punctuation rule. Use a period or a comma. Do not use an em dash, en dash, hyphen-as-dash, or parentheses as a dash substitute. A colon is allowed only when it introduces a list or example (see Colon overuse below), not as an explanation crutch after a dash removal. Before returning the final rewrite, scan it for `—` and `–`. Any hit means the draft isn't done.

**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.

**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.

**Before:**
> The new policy — announced without warning — affects thousands of workers. The changes -- long overdue according to critics -- will take effect immediately.

**After:**
> The new policy, announced without warning, affects thousands of workers. The changes, long overdue according to critics, will take effect immediately.

### Colon overuse

Colons are fine before a list or example. Not as mid-sentence connectors. "If you're coming from traditional automation: instead of registering event handlers, you describe conditions" adds nothing with the colon. Rewrite to let the point stand on its own without comparison framing. "Describing when the scheduler should fire works best as plain English." Same meaning, no crutch punctuation.

### 15. Overuse of boldface

**Problem:** AI chatbots emphasize phrases in boldface mechanically. Don't bold every proper noun or acronym.

**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.

**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.

### 16. Inline-header vertical lists

**Problem:** AI outputs lists where items start with bolded headers followed by colons. The tell is a bold label and colon that restates the line: "**Performance:** Performance improved...". Convert those to prose. A bold lead-in that ends in a period, names the item, and is followed by genuinely new detail ("**Schema in TypeScript.** Tables live in one file.") is fine, not a tell.

**Before:**

> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.

**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.

### 17. Title case in headings

**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings. Use sentence case.

**Before:**

> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships

**After:**

> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships

### 18. Emojis

**Problem:** AI chatbots often decorate headings or bullet points with emojis. Remove from headings and bullets.

**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting

**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.

### 19. Curly quotation marks

**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes (“...”) instead of straight quotes ("...").

**Before:**
> He said “the project is on track” but others disagreed.

**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.
