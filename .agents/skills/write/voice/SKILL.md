# Voice

Read [write](../SKILL.md) first, then [process](../process/SKILL.md).

## Voice calibration (optional)

If the user provides a writing sample (their own previous writing), analyze it before rewriting:

1. **Read the sample first.** Note:
   - Sentence length patterns (short and punchy? Long and flowing? Mixed?)
   - Word choice level (casual? academic? somewhere between?)
   - How they start paragraphs (jump right in? Set context first?)
   - Punctuation habits (lots of dashes? Parenthetical asides? Semicolons?)
   - Any recurring phrases or verbal tics
   - How they handle transitions (explicit connectors? Just start the next point?)

2. **Match their voice in the rewrite.** Don't just remove AI patterns - replace them with patterns from the sample. If they write short sentences, don't produce long ones. If they use "stuff" and "things," don't upgrade to "elements" and "components."

3. **When no sample is provided,** use a natural, varied voice appropriate to the register. Do not assume that a stronger, warmer, or more opinionated voice is wanted.

### How to provide a sample

- Inline: "Humanize this text. Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching: [sample]"
- File: "Humanize this text. Use my writing style from [file path] as a reference."

## Personality and soul

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

**Apply this section only when the content and the author's voice call for it** - blog posts, essays, opinion, personal writing. For encyclopedic, technical, legal, or reference text, neutral and plain *is* the correct human voice; do not inject opinions or first person there.

Removing patterns is half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious.

### Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean")

- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

### How to preserve or add voice

These steps come from both source skills. Use them when the register allows it. For technical docs, keep the rhythm and specificity; skip first person and injected opinion.

**Use opinions only when they belong to the author.** React to facts instead of neutrally listing pros and cons when the source or requested register supports that voice. Never manufacture a stance to make text sound human.

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going. Mix it up.

**Acknowledge complexity.** "Impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "impressive."

**Use "I" only when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional, but do not invent personal experience, preferences, or reactions. Skip it in encyclopedic, technical, legal, or reference text.

**Keep deliberate roughness.** Perfect structure can feel algorithmic, but do not add tangents, asides, fragments, or half-formed thoughts unless the author's sample or the requested register supports them.

**Be specific.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am."

### Never manufacture humanity

Do not add:

- invented anecdotes, sources, quotations, or personal experiences
- forced candor, fake uncertainty, humor, or contrarian opinions
- dramatic fragments, slang, or informality that the author did not use
- emotional claims that are not supported by the surrounding facts

Human-sounding writing comes from accurate detail and an earned voice, not from adding visible imperfections.

### Before (clean but soulless)

> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

### After (has a pulse)

> I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle, but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.

## Detection guidance

### What NOT to flag (false positives)

A clean human writer can hit several of the patterns above without any AI involvement. Before rewriting, sanity-check that you are not gutting legitimate prose. The following are *not* reliable indicators on their own:

- **Perfect grammar and consistent style.** Many writers are professionals or have been edited. Polish does not equal AI.
- **Mixed casual and formal registers.** This often signals a person in a technical field, a young writer, or someone with neurodivergent prose habits, not a chatbot.
- **"Bland" or "robotic" prose.** AI prose has *specific* tells. Generic dryness without those tells is just dry writing.
- **Formal or academic vocabulary.** AI overuses *specific* fancy words (see [language](../language/SKILL.md)), not all fancy words. Don't flatten "ostensibly" or "constituent" just because they sound brainy.
- **Letter-style opening or closing on a comment.** Salutations and sign-offs predate ChatGPT by centuries.
- **Common transition words in isolation.** *Additionally*, *moreover*, *consequently* are AI-coded only when piled up. One *however* is not a tell.
- **Curly quotes alone.** macOS, Word, Google Docs, and most CMSes auto-curl by default. Curly quotes only count when stacked with other tells.
- **Em dashes alone.** Many editors and journalists use them often. Em dashes are evidence only when paired with formulaic sales-y rhythm.
- **One short emphatic sentence.** Humans use clipped sentences to land a point. Flag staccato drama only when several short fragments appear in a row and inflate the tone.
- **"Honestly" or "look" mid-sentence.** These are ordinary in casual writing. The tell is the standalone theatrical opener, not the word itself.
- **Unsourced claims.** Most of the web is unsourced. Lack of citations doesn't prove anything.
- **Correct, complex formatting.** Visual editors and templates produce clean output without any AI.

When in doubt, look for **clusters** of tells, not isolated ones. A single em dash means nothing; em dashes plus rule-of-three plus *vibrant tapestry* plus a "Conclusion" section is a confession.

For text you write in this repository, still strip em dashes from text you write. The false-positive note above is about judging someone else's existing prose, not about leaving dashes in new drafts. See [style](../style/SKILL.md).

### Signs of human writing (preserve these)

When you see these, lean toward leaving the prose alone. They are evidence of a real person writing, and over-editing will destroy what makes the piece sound human:

- **Specific, unusual, hard-to-fabricate detail.** A real address. A weird quote. The phrase "the lawyer who used to work upstairs from my dentist." LLMs round off specifics; humans hoard them.
- **Mixed feelings and unresolved tension.** "I think this is mostly good, but it bothers me, and I can't fully explain why." LLMs default to clean takes.
- **Dated, era-bound references.** Slang, memes, or in-jokes that map to a specific year and subculture. Models lag by a year or more.
- **First-person editorial choices the writer can defend.** If the writer can explain *why* they made a particular cut or used a particular word, that's a strong human signal.
- **Variety in sentence length.** Real writing alternates short and long. AI writing tends toward an even, mid-length cadence.
- **Genuine asides, parentheticals, or self-corrections.** "(I keep wanting to say 'almost' here, but it really was certain.)" Models rarely interrupt themselves like this.
- **Edits made before November 30, 2022.** ChatGPT's public launch. Anything older than that is, with very rare exceptions, not AI-written.
